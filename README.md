# Projects Engine with React

Fuel your digital ambitions with Projects Engine. From software solutions to hardware projects, we provide tools for tech enthusiasts at every level.

## Getting started

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where UI changes frequently based on user interactions. React allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state and efficiently update the DOM (Document Object Model) when data changes.

## Prerequisites

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It comes with the V8 JavaScript engine, which is also used by Google Chrome. Node.js allows you to build server-side applications using JavaScript.

npm is a package manager for Node.js, and it's installed automatically when you install Node.js. npm is used to install, manage, and publish packages or modules for Node.js applications. It's a crucial tool for managing dependencies in your projects, including React.js and its related libraries.

Having Node.js and npm installed on your system is essential for setting up a React development environment and managing your project's dependencies. Once you have them installed, you can easily install React and other necessary packages using npm.

## Create the application

```
npx create-react-app projectsengine
```

This command will create a new React project called "projectsengine". Remember to have Node.js and npm installed on your system before running this command. After the command completes, you can navigate into your newly created project directory and start working on your React application.

```
cd projectsengine
npm run start
```

To check the version of Node.js installed on your system, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```
node -v
```

To check the version of npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```
npm -v
```

## Main directories
- node_modules: This directory contains all the third-party dependencies (libraries, packages, modules) that your React app relies on. When you use npm or yarn to install packages, they are stored in this directory. It's usually not recommended to manually modify or interact with files in this directory, as npm or yarn manages it for you.

- public: This directory contains static assets that are served directly by the web server without any processing. It typically includes the HTML file(s), images, fonts, and other assets that are needed for your app to run. The index.html file in this directory is the main HTML file for your React app, and it's where your React components will be mounted.

- src: This directory contains the source code of your React application. It's where you'll write most of your code, including React components, JavaScript files, CSS files, and any other assets specific to your application. The index.js file in this directory is typically the entry point of your React application, where you import and render your main React component.

- package.json: This file serves as a manifest for your project and includes metadata about the project, as well as a list of dependencies and scripts for managing the project.
